Upgrade Git to 2.5.2 in CentOS 6.4 through yum
LINUX CENTOS RPM GIT
I found it is impossible to find lastest Git in yum repo. Fortunately, the Git source base has provided make rule to build RPM package. Note you have to build the rpm from the source code repo. Building rpm from source tarball is not supported.

yum install curl-devel expat-devel xmlto asciidoc
git clone https://github.com/git/git.git
cd git
make rpm
Find the rpms in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64

Install RPM:

Remove existing Git:
yum remove git-all git
yum clean packages
create local yum repo:
yum install createrepo
cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
createrepo .
Create repo file: /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
[local]
name=Git-Local
baseurl=file:///root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
protect=1
yum install git
